## üîÑ How to Replace Sounds

### Method 1: Direct Replacement (Recommended)
1. **Keep the same filenames** for automatic loading:
   - `background.wav` - Your background music
   - `collision.wav` - Your crash sound
   - `fuel.wav` - Your fuel pickup sound
   - `menu.wav` - Your menu sound
   - `engine.wav` - Your engine sound (optional fallback)

2. **Place your files** in this `sounds/` folder
3. **Restart the game** - it will automatically load your new sounds

### Method 2: Different Filenames
1. Place your sound files in this folder with any name
2. Edit `main.py` in the `load_sounds()` method
3. Update the filename in the sound_files dictionary:
   ```python
   sound_files = {
       'collision': 'sounds/your_crash_sound.wav',
       'fuel': 'sounds/your_fuel_sound.wav',
       'menu': 'sounds/your_menu_sound.wav',
       'background': 'sounds/your_background_music.wav'
   }
   ```

## üìè Audio Specifications

### Recommended Format:
- **File Format**: WAV (preferred) or MP3
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz (CD quality)
- **Bit Depth**: 16-bit

## üé® Sound Design Tips

### Background Music:
- **Style**: Electronic, ambient, or driving music works well

- **Looping**: Ensure smooth loop points (no clicks/pops)
- **Energy**: Should maintain excitement without being distracting

### Sound Effects:

- **Menu Navigation**: Subtle, clean sound (click, beep, blip)

### Technical Quality:
- **No Clipping**: Avoid audio distortion
- **Consistent Volume**: Similar loudness across all effects
- **Clean Audio**: No background noise or artifacts
- **Proper Fade**: Fade in/out to avoid clicks

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Sound not playing**: Check filename spelling and file format
2. **Audio too loud/quiet**: Game has automatic volume control, but check source levels
3. **Clicking/popping**: Ensure proper fade in/out on audio files
4. **Won't loop**: Background music automatically loops regardless of file length

### Supported Formats:
- ‚úÖ **WAV** (recommended)

## üéØ Testing Your Sounds

### Quick Test:

2. Run the game: `python main.py`
3. Check console output for loading confirmation
4. Test in-game:
   - Background music starts automatically
   - Navigate menus to test menu sounds
   - Collect fuel to test fuel sounds
   - Crash into cars to test collision sounds

### Audio Status:
- Game shows "üîä Audio: ON" when sounds are working
- Shows "üîá Audio: OFF" with visual feedback when audio unavailable
- Console shows which sounds loaded successfully
